Hi I’m Wren (+ other names) I’m 20 and a nonbinary aroace lesbian

I am diagnosed with autism and other (mental and physical) issues I don’t feel like listing but it will affect how I interact with people so keep that in mind! I can go from extremely talkative to burnt out and vice versa at random

Interests 
> Creepypasta/Slenderverse (though it’s been a while since I’ve watched anything but Marble Hornets), The Adventure Zone, Red vs Blue (and some other RT shows but this is the main one I like), Pokemon, ENA, Project Moon, The Walking Dead (Telltale), Angels of Death (game), Portal, Umamusume, Haunted Hotel, etc etc I have a lot more these are just off the top of my head  if we share any interests I’d looove to have a conversation I’m very excitable about my interests and it’s hard to get me to shut up about them 

DNI
> Basic DNI criteria, zionists, minors!!!!!!!! I’m on the 18+ server for a reason, I’d prefer to talk to other adults 😭 

Ponytown boundaries 
> Cuddling and hiding is ok!!! Especially if your skin is from what mine is from I think it’s cute. Ask about shippy interactions though but I feel like that should be obvious. Please don’t roleplay with me. Please do not outright steal or colorpick from my skins, I put a lot of effort and time into them. Vague inspo is okay though ofc!!

I get embarrassed really easily so I prefer whispering to public chat unless there’s multiple people in the conversation. I’m also afk a lot and only have personal chat open so if you say something to me I might not see it at all unless it’s whispered
